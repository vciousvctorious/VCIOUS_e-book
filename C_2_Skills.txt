|CHAPTER_2 : Skills
.------------------------------------
|Starting in infosec requires some skill that you might
|get better at as needed in your infosec journey, noting few:
|1)Programming:
| |if you cant write your own code, atleast be
| |able to read it, this field requires alot of
| |programming knowledge, but you dont really need
| |to master every programming language
| |honorable mentions:
| |python3,sql queries, basic web languages, shell,
| |some c would be nice since ull learn memory management and stuff
|2)Networking:
| |while hacking servers, wifi , or even software, you'll
| |need networking knowledge, im not saying you must know 
| |how to configure routers etc, the knowledge we need is 
| |something like this :
| |1)IP
| | |Ip adresses are basically virtual ID's
| | |theres 2 variations of those ipv4 and ipv6, you'll mainly
| | |be working with v4, try education yourself about those
| |2)Ports
| | |Since all your local devices are connected to your router
| | |we consider the router as a gate to the outside world
| | |when we send something you actually send it to your router
| | |wich then forwards it to the outside world, but what if
| | |you receive something? it'll all make sence when you study
| | |networking and routing, but for the sake of basic knowledge
| | |ports are like windows wich data can flow into running services
| | |as an example, when visiting an http page, you are actually telling
| | |that server's router to let you flow on port 80,
| | |wich is reserved for http.
| |3)Communication
| | |knowing how machines communicate, as an example,
| | |a TCP handshake, (tcp is a protocol wich insures data is delivered)
| | |and its counterpart is UDP (protocol wich doesnt insure delivery of data)
| | |1)Client sends SYN request the server (synchronize)
| | |2)Server replies with SYN/ACK (synchronize, acknowledge)
| | |3)Client replies with ACK (acknowledge)
| | |Then the servers starts sending data.
|3)RTFM, and GOOGLE!:
| |If you cant make your own research , please learn
| |and when asking someone, your query should be:
| |i got problem X heres what i know, give solution
| |and not:
| |hey can anyone help me?
|4)SYSTEMS
| |As a hacker you must know how systems and there files work
| |you should also be comfortable in using them
| |manipulating with a linux terminal is a great solution
| |since the transition from a shell to cmd isnt that hard
