|CHAPTER_3 : Learning
.------------------------------------
|6 simple steps from my point of view
|-Find exploit (research).
|-Learn The Exploit.
|-Learn The Requirements.
|-Perform The exploit.
|-Create your own script.
|-Repeat
|In further chapters ill be explaining some
|fundamental and VERY known exploits, but
|for now, lets give an example using SQL injection
|now that you know that something called SQL injection
|exists, welcome to part 2, learning the exploit
|we know that SQL is used for database related things
|in order to communicate with a SQL database we use
|SQL Queries , lets assume that we got a username input
|that we are trying to exploit.
|QUERY : SELECT * FROM db where user = '$input'
|the only way we can communicate with this query is with
|our input, this query expects normal input, but what it doesnt
|expect is something that would break it, lets try ' as an input
|QUERY : SELECT * FROM db where user = '''
|This gives an error due to the QUERY breaking
|but how could we abuse this ?
|Lets input ' VERYBADCODE #
|QUERY : SELECT * FROM db where user = '' VERYBADCODE #'
|its that easy to inject bad code.
|now you are expected to test this, simply lookup : SQLInjection CTF
|to perform the exploit ull need a tool to generate that VERYBADCODE
|a recommended tool would be SQLmap,
|now that you know the exploit, how it works and how to perform it
|you might wanna start learning how to create your own VERYBADCODE
|or perhaps a script that does it for you. this opens up learning opportunity
|if creating your own script is way too hard for you, no problem baby steps
|are also fine, take it easy the more you learn the better.
